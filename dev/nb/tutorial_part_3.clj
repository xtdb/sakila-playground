;; # Updating the Past

;; In [part 2](tutorial_part_2), we queried the historical timeline, to understand what changes were made.

;; In this part, we will understand how to insert historical data into XTDB.

;; How does this work with an immutable database!? Let's find out together.

;; Let's pretend the day today is 2024-01-01, and we insert a product:

^{::clerk/no-cache true ::clerk/visibility {:code :hide :result :hide}}
(set-time #inst "2024-01-01")

^{::clerk/no-cache true}
(e "INSERT INTO product (xt$id, name, price)"
   "VALUES "
   "(1, 'Pendleton Electric Bicycle', 340)")

;; Let's query the day after this insert:

^{::clerk/no-cache true}
(q "SELECT * FROM product FOR VALID_TIME AS OF DATE '2024-01-02'")

;; Now, let's query against the past, in **2023**

;; We should NOT see any data, because the product was inserted into the database on `2024-01-01`:

^{::clerk/no-cache true}
(q "SELECT * FROM product FOR VALID_TIME AS OF DATE '2023-01-01'")

;; ## Inserting Historical Data

;; But let's say, we want to insert some historical data into our database, all the way back in **2022**.

;; This could an import from another system, into our XTDB golden store.

;; We achieve this in XT by setting the `xt$valid_from` and `xt$valid_to` column

^{::clerk/no-cache true}
(e "INSERT INTO product (xt$id, name, price, xt$valid_from, xt$valid_to)"
   "VALUES "
   "(1, 'Pendleton Electric Bicycle', 300, DATE '2022-01-01', DATE '2024-01-01')")

;; Now if we query in **2024**, we still get the **2024** value

^{::clerk/no-cache true}
(q "SELECT * FROM product FOR VALID_TIME AS OF DATE '2024-01-02'")

;; But if we query in **2023**, we should see the older **2022** value:

^{::clerk/no-cache true}
(q "SELECT * FROM product FOR VALID_TIME AS OF DATE '2023-01-01'")

;; If we query in **2020**, we should see nothing:

^{::clerk/no-cache true}
(q "SELECT * FROM product FOR VALID_TIME AS OF DATE '2020-01-01'")

;; ## Conclusion

;; We've shown that it's possible to insert records into the past.
;;
;; What about if we want to update historical data? How does this work with
;; an immutable database?

;; Let's find out in [part 4](tutorial_part_4)
